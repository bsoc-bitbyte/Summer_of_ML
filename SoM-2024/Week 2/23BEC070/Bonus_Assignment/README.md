# CP Rating Predictor
A webapp to predict your competitive programming ratings based on your platform.

## **Overview**

This project aims to predict competitive programming ratings based on user data from popular platforms like CodeChef and Codeforces. I cleaned the data and ran some EDA, then used Linear regression to find the relationship between the two platforms. By analyzing and modeling the relationship between user ratings on these platforms, we can predict a user's rating on one platform given their rating on the other.


## **Results**

The prediction model was effective in accurately predicting user ratings. This means that the model was able to reliably estimate a user's rating on one platform based on their rating on the other platform.

I have created an website based on the results of machine learning model from python file you can check out the website from here[https://phoenix681.github.io/CP_Rating_Predictor/]
